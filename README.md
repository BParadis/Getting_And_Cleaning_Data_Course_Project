# Getting_And_Cleaning_Data_Course_Project

The main objectives for this project where to:

1) Download and unzip the data file
2) Create a source code that would meet the criteria noted below
3) Produce a tidy data file through the project source code

The data includes two sets of variables: the Y set involves the activity type that the subject performed while the data was being recorded and the X set which are the sensor signals that were measured from waist-mounted smartphones on 30 individuals.

The Data for the project was found in the following location:

The project should have met the following criteria

Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The script for the project can be found in run_analysis.R.  The independent tidy data set is noted as newtidydata.txt.
